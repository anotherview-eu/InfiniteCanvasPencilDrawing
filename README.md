# InfiniteCanvasPencilDrawing
Simple drawing app using PencilKit.

This sample app allows the user to draw on an infinite canvas. The user can only scroll inside the area of the drawing (plus some margins).
The trick to limit scrolling to this area is using negative 'contentInset'.

This drawing canvas is part of [Escape](http://escapeapp.cloud), mind mapping app for iOS.
